# Your first front-end framework: React

- Repository: `intro-react`
- Mode: `solo`
- Type of Challenge: `learning`
- Duration: `5 days`
- Deployment: `Github pages` or `Heroku`

## Learning Objectives

Let's look into a JavaScript framework!
At the end of this 5-day challenge you will:

- be able to create a new React application
- be able to organize your app in components
- be able to use basic hooks for managing state and reactivity
- be able to "think in React"

## Your mission

This time the task is simple: you will build a small Todo application that lives in your browser, and saves todos even after restarting the browser.

## Useful resources

React introduces a few uncommon concepts that can be difficult to understand at first. Here is a list of useful resources you can refer to - before, during, and after this exercise.

#### Official Documentation

It's well written and made available in many languages.

- Main concepts with the official doc tutorial: https://react.dev/learn 
- "Thinking in React": https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react 

#### YouTube

There is a TON of React material on YouTube. Choose your own flavor, but make sure that you watch videos that were released in the last year or so.

One suggestion, very relevant to this exercise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY

_Side note: a couple of years ago React went from using mainly "class" based components to mainly "functional" components. Any tutorial that focuses on functional components, and special functions called "hooks" is (more) up to date. Don't waste time on class components, they are the old way. We will have a quick look at it though_

#### Online Course

Again, there are a TON of courses out there. The same rule applies: make sure they are recent, and they use functional components and hooks.

A good, free, course: https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react

#### Blogs

Sometimes you will find a good explanation for a specific feature or problem in blogs. These are two blogs that always deliver high-quality content:

- https://kentcdodds.com/blog/
- https://www.robinwieruch.de/blog

## Deliverables

1. Publish the source code on your GitHub repository
2. Deploy the project: with Github Pages or Heroku

## Time to spare?

Have you completed the exercise for the day and don't know what to do with the remaining hours?

- See if someone else needs help.
- Refactor parts you aren't happy with.
- Improve on your project so it's not only a learning repository, but also a show off project when interviewing:
  - Add styling
  - Improve responsiveness
  - Check for little, smooth effects (watch out: animation in React needs some special libraries. You can use CSS animations for now, or look into libraries like Framer Motion or React Spring)
  - Think UX: what extra features can make your todo app better?
- Rebuild from scratch without any tutorial to improve your understanding.
- Have a live edit option for existing todo's (when you click on the text of a todo, the app allows you to edit it in place).
- Make a version with another JS framework like VueJS or Svelte.

## Good luck!
